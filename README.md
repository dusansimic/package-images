# Package images

Container images of various programs. The images can be used for simply running
programs but they also be used as a distribution method.

## Available packages

All the packages available are listed here. They are automatically updated but
the mechanism is not perfect so it might break at some point in the future. If
that happens you can open a ticket on the
[bug tracker](https://github.com/dusansimic/package-images/issues).
